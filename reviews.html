        <p class="review-quote">"We rented the Lily Pad for our daughters birthday to use at the lake. I wasn’t sure if everyone would like it or not but our entire group ages 4-45 played on it for hours. The little kids liked to crawl, sit and jump off. The bigger kids liked running across it and playing king of the pad. And the parents liked lounging on it while watching the kids. It’s large but easy to use we had no problem strapping it to the top of our van and it was easy for two people to carry it to and from the water. It was an inexpensive option for hours of fun on the water! Russell was great to work with and helped load it. I HIGHLY recommend!
